Interpreter

This project is an interpreter for a simple programming language that allows variable declaration, basic arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and printing. The programming language has its syntax rules, and the interpreter reads the code from a text file and executes it accordingly (ex. aaa.txt).

Features:

The programming language supported by this interpreter includes the following features:
1. Variable Declaration: You can declare variables of type num (integer), str (string), and logic (boolean) and assign values to them.
2. Arithmetic Operations: You can perform basic arithmetic operations on variables and literals, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. Conditional Statements: The interpreter supports basic conditional statements using the if keyword. It can evaluate expressions with comparison operators (==, !=, >, <) to determine the condition's truth value.
4. Printing: You can print the values of variables and literals to the console.
5. Error Handling: The interpreter provides basic error handling for incorrect keywords, operations, and variable references.

Usage:

1. First, create a text file containing the code written in the supported programming language.
2. Run the program by compiling and executing the code in the C++ environment. The program will prompt you to enter the name of the text file with the code.
3. The interpreter will read the code from the file, interpret it, and execute the instructions accordingly.

Notes:

* The interpreter is limited to basic arithmetic and conditional operations and may not support advanced programming concepts.
* Please ensure that the code in the text file follows the syntax rules defined in the interpreter. Any incorrect or unsupported syntax might result in errors or unexpected behavior.
